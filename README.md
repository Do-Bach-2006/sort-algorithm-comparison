This repo is created for the 1st class of data structure and algorithm assignment

The dataset I used for testing <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VfrIGc1ZpCuwiiXyJ6wUQZbsD3SPWdPY/view?usp=sharing>

Overall. My implemented version of sort algorithms still not yield the highest performance out of the code.
But overall, it implemented the core idea of sorting algorithm and how these algorithms works.
It is proved that my algorithms is outperformed by the build in numpy sort functions
